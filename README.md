# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web application designed to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. This tool helps both beginners and experienced developers understand the mechanics behind each algorithm through an interactive, visual approach.

**Live Demo:** [Sorting Visualizer](#)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while also providing an educational tool for those interested in learning about sorting algorithms. The visualizations make it easier to comprehend how these algorithms work by demonstrating their steps in real-time.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application supports the following classic sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   A simple comparison-based algorithm where each element is compared with the next and swapped if necessary.

2. **Insertion Sort**  
   Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparing each new element with the already sorted portion of the array.

3. **Selection Sort**  
   Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the sorted portion.

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together in sorted order.

5. **Quick Sort**  
   Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays based on whether elements are smaller or larger than the pivot, recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the sorting algorithms in action as they manipulate arrays step by step.
- **Control Speed**: Adjust the speed of the animation to better understand each algorithmâ€™s operations.
- **Supports Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for those learning about algorithms and data structures.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing the sorting algorithms and interactive features.
